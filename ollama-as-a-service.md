# Ollama as a service

1. Check if Ollama is Running as a Service

First, you need to check if Ollama is set up as a system service. You can look for it using systemctl, which is the system and service manager in Debian-based systems.

bash

sudo systemctl status ollama*

This command will show you the status of any service that starts with 'ollama'. If Ollama is installed as a service, you should see it listed.
2. Review the Service Configuration

If Ollama is indeed running as a system service, check its configuration to understand how itâ€™s set up:

bash

sudo systemctl cat ollama.service

Replace ollama.service with the actual service name if it differs. This command displays the content of the service file, which includes details like the executable path, options, and environment variables.
3. Modify Service to Allow Remote Connections

If the service is running and you want to make it listen on a network interface that allows remote connections, you will likely need to edit its configuration file. This file is typically located in /etc/ollama/, /etc/default/, or directly referenced in the service file.

    Edit the Configuration File

    Open the configuration file with a text editor:

    bash

sudo nano /etc/ollama/ollama.conf

Look for settings related to IP bindings or network interfaces and change them from localhost or 127.0.0.1 to 0.0.0.0 or a specific external IP address of your server. This change will allow connections from other computers.

Restart the Service

After making changes, restart the service to apply them:

bash

sudo systemctl restart ollama.service
